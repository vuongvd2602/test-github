# **Java OOP**
## *Encapsulation*
Encapsulation allows hiding information and the internal properties of the object. Other objects cannot directly affect the data inside and change the state of that object, but must go through public methods provided by that object.
## *Inheritance*
Many objects that share the same characteristics can be grouped into an inheritance tree. Inheritance allows building a new class called `child class`, inheriting and reusing properties methods based on the old class called `parent class` that existed before. The Child classes inherit all the members of the Parent class and do not need to be redefined. Helps to avoid redundant code that just handles the same job.
> Ex: Humans have gender, age and occupation, so the `parent class` is humans and `child classes` will be workers, teachers, doctors...
## *Polymorphism*
The same thing but with different representations, different ways of performing.
> Ex: With the same guitar, but playing different notes will produce different sounds.
## *Abstraction*
Generalizing an object
